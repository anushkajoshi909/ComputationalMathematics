Our goal is to analyse the superdiffusive behaviour of these particles and identify the optimal conditions for efficient movement. 

We have done this using the following expermients-
1) First Setup Particles movement restricted to a Bounded Plane
2) Second Setup Unbounded Particle Propagation

We are considering a spherical particle that self-propels with a constant speed along a given internal orientation direction in 2D.
In order to model stochastic dynamics, we use 100 random variables following the Normal probability distribution (mean = 0).
